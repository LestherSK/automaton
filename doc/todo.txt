- easy support for printf and similar functions
  - look at avr-libc <stdio.h> documentation, specifically fdevopen()
  - look at vfprintf() docs for info on how to choose printf() implementation
  - reimplement a simpler printf() if it's too big
- assert (with file/line; not ##)
  - how to pool strings (for filename?)
- go to sleep when waiting for things to happen
- use uart_flush()
  - flush in uart_stop()? with timeout?
  - die() and reset() should probably flush the uart(s), with timeout
    - or: have printf(), assert(), etc write synchronously

test:
- time/alarm
- algo/fifo
- io/uart
