rev1 errata


major

- GPS UART pin assignments on the XMEGA are idiotic (should be GPS_TX on PD2 and
  GPS_RX on PD3)
  - WORKAROUND: cut PD1, PD2, PD3, rewire so that PD1 is CAN_STANDY, and PD2 and 
    PD3 are GPS_TX and GPS_RX

- Upper-right PCB mount hole should be at (99.5, 51) mm but is actually at
  (99.5, 50) mm
  - WORKAROUND: use 3 mounting screws

- MOSFETs for LCD backlight are all wrong: currently they have drain connected
  to +3.3V and source connected thru resistor to BL- pin; should have source
  connected to GND, and drain connected to resistor/BL- pin
  - WORKAROUND: use MCU IO ports directly


minor

- Insufficient clearance between the 3.3v regulator and the box of the OBD
  right-angle header (very tight clearance with 5v regulator as well)

- USB connector protrudes too far: makes inserting PCB into box difficult

- Battery connector impinges on capacitor to the right; also, the negative
  terminal is completely beneath the plastic and therefore difficult to solder

- Reset button solder pads are too tiny (don't extend out enough) to make good
  electrical connections

- LED resistors are too high-value: switch to 110ohm for green (FTDI RX, pwr)
  and 150ohm for red (FTDI TX)


component changes

- Mini USB connector: switch for one that's easier to solder

- Battery connector: switch for one that's easier to solder (upright?)


CHECK THESE THINGS!

- All actual component footprints: check for overlaps!

- Pin headers need pin 1 marked in silkscreen
